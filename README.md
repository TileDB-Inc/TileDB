# The Fastest Array Storage Engine

TileDB allows you to store and access very large multi-dimensional array data, the data currency of Data Science. It is a powerful storage engine that introduces a novel format that can effectively store both **dense** and **sparse** array data with support for fast updates and reads. It is cloud-optimized and features excellent **compression** and an efficient parallel I/O system for **high scalability**. TileDB works on Linux, macOS, and Windows, and is open-sourced under the permissive MIT License.
