# Environments for CMake
# -------------------------------------------------------
#
# An environment is a context that provides defaults and abbreviations for
# common use cases. The name "environment" is drawn from LaTeX, which builds
# upon the "raw" macro language Tex to create something closer to block-
# structured programming. Environments can replace boilerplate-heavy code where
# there is sufficient variation that the resulting code cannot be readily
# generated from the arguments to a function call.
#
# Environments themselves provide a small number of services
# - Syntax matching for commence/conclude.
#     This facility ensures the integrity of pairing of "commence" and
#     "conclude". Environments may be nested.
# - Properties on the environment.
#     This provides a reliable way of storing environment-specific data. Such
#     data does not persist past the end of the environment, but it can be
#     accessed during the post-processing step.
# - A unique prefix property.
#     A unique prefix affords most of the benefits of a namespace.
#
# Environments in CMake share many of the limitations of CMake itself:
# 1. The environment does not create a new scope, so there's no concept of local
#    variables inside the environment. This is not desirable, but it's necessary
#    because CMake has no way of making a scope other than directory or function
#    scopes.
# 2. There's no way to reuse names of existing functions to provide alternate
#    versions with environment-provided arguments. Instead, there are new
#    environment-aware functions that do so.
# 3. CMake has no namespacing or aliasing facility but only a single, global
#    namespace. It is too risky to use function names "begin" and "end" in light
#    of future CMake-defined functions. Thus we use the adequate but partly-
#    surprising names "commence" and "conclude".
# 4. CMake has no way of extending its property system to new kinds of objects.
#    So, for example, we have "this_set_property" instead of an extension
#    to "set_property".

# -------------------------------------------------------
# Using environments
# -------------------------------------------------------
#
# This section describes the generic, shared syntax of all environments. It's
# minimal, since it's only about delimiting blocks of code. See the
# documentation for specific environments for how to use them.
#
# `commence( <environment-name> )`
# - [in] environment-name: The name of the environment
#
# `conclude( <environment-name> )`
# - [in] environment-name: The name of the environment
# - Precondition: the environment name must match that of the current open
#     environment.
#
# `commence` opens an environment block. The call to `commence` itself requires
# no other arguments, but particular environments may require additional
# arguments. It's conventional that an identifier for an environment be the
# first additional argument. For example the `define_environment` environment
# requires the name of the new environment as an additional argument.
#
# `conclude` closes an environment block. There must be an open environment, and
# its argument must the name of that environment.
#
# Environment blocks may be nested.
#
# Environments allow the created of context-specific data through environment
# properties. These are analogous to the CMake language properties but are
# implemented separately. The properties of an environment are only available
# within that environment. Properties may be used explicitly in user code as
# something like a block-local variable, but are more often used to implement
# environments.
#
# Environmental names are identifiers for environments, properties, and for
# names that specific environments require. Valid environmental names consist
# only of those characters valid in CMake variable names, namely, alphanumeric
# characters and the underscore. This is a technical limitation, because we
# incorporate environmental names into the names of CMake variables.

# -------------------------------------------------------
# Defining new environments
# -------------------------------------------------------
#
# "define_environment" is an environment for defining new environments. We
# manually implement "define_environment" in order to define it without infinite
# recursion. All other environments are defined with "define_environment".
#
# commence( define_environment <environment-name> )
# - [in] <environment-name>
# - Precondition: <environment-name> must be a valid environmental name
#
# Environments have three data:
# - Environment name. This is the argument to `define_environment`. This
#     parameter is mandatory.
# - Commence hook. This macro or function runs during `commence()`. If the
#     commence-hook fails, then the end hook does not run. This parameter is
#     optional. The parameter is set by assigning a macro or function name to
#     the property `commence_hook`.
# - Conclude hook. This macro or function runs during `conclude()`. This
#     parameter is optional. The parameter is set by assigning a macro or
#     function name to the property `conclude_hook`.
#
# `<commence_hook>( Success_Variable [Args...] )`
# - [out] Result_Variable: The begin-hook returns success by assigning "true" to
#     this variable. It return failure by assigning "false".
# - [in] Args...: All the arguments passed to `commence()`
#
# `<conclude_hook>( Success_Variable [Args...] )`
# - [in] Args...: All the arguments passed to `conclude()`
#
# Both the commence and conclude hooks run *in the same context* that the calls
# `commence()` and `conclude()` run in. They may be defined either as macros or
# functions insofar as the environment system is concerned. There are some
# consequences:
# - If defined as macros:
#   - Makes setting properties easy, because there's no need to manually forward
#     property values to the parent scope.
#   - Has hazard of name pollution with temporary variables. All variables
#     should begin with a unique prefix.
#   - May not call `return()`.
# - If defined as functions:
#   - Setting properties in a function body will not set them in the context
#     of the caller. This means that property values have to be explicitly set
#     in the parent scope.
#     - Note: At present there is no utility function to do this.
#   - Temporary variables may be used at will.
#   - `return()` is safe.
#
# Recommended practice for commence and conclude hooks:
# - Define the hook as a macro, but also define a tightly-bound function for it
#   that's an implementation detail of the macro.
# - Perform input validation etc. in the function. Variables that need to be
#   set in the macro can be set directly in the parent scope of the function.
# - Set properties in the macro. Do as much as possible otherwise in the
#   function.
#
# Recommended practive for defining environments
# - Put the environment definition into a separate `.cmake` module and
#   `include()` it when the environment is needed.
# - Use `include_guard()` at the top of the `.cmake` file. Environments don't
#   like being defined twice.

# -------------------------------------------------------
# Implementation of the services
# -------------------------------------------------------
#
# - Properties are forwarded to properties on a particular variable. The name of
#     the variable is thus:
#     1. A global prefix for environment names
#     2. The name of the environment
# - The prefix is the concatenation of property-variable name and an underscore.

#
# Debugging flag for the environment system
#
# If "false", this flag turns off invariant checks etc. for performance
#
set(TileDB_Environment_Debug ON)

#
# The block nesting level
#
# This variable is a cross-check against the length of the block list.
#
set(TileDB_Environment_Level 1)

#
# The block nesting list
#
# Invariant: TileDB_Environment_Level == length of TileDB_Environment_Blocks
#
# This list contains the names of all current blocks that have commenced but
# not yet concluded.
#
list(APPEND TileDB_Environment_Blocks "<root>")

#
# The current error state
#
# Invariant: TileDB_Environment_Level == length of TileDB_Environment_Errors
#
# We need one of these per environment, since a problem within a `commence`
# statement needs to be known during `conclude`.
#
list(APPEND TileDB_Environment_Errors false)

#
# The current `This`
#
# Invariant: TileDB_Environment_Level == length of TileDB_Environment_This
#
# We use a single name `This` in multiple environments, so we need to restore it
# whenever we leave an environment.
#
list(APPEND TileDB_Environment_This "<nothing>")

#
# Namespace initial strings for defined environments
#
# The concatenation of one of these strings and an environment forms a namespace
# for that environment. This is not the same as the variable prefix for the
# namespace, which is this string plus an underscore. We use multiple namespaces
# here to avoid any problems with malicious naming, such as (with a different
# naming convention, "foo" and "foo_begin", where "foo_begin" might be the name
# both of the begin-hook of environment "foo" and also an environment itself.
#
# Each of the prefixes is of the form `TileDB_Environment_<keyword>_`. The
# keywords:
# - Named: A variable of this name is created for each environment that stores
# properties for the environment type (but not for individual environments).
# - Begin: The name of the commence-hook for an environment
# - End: The name of the conclude-hook for an environment
# - This: The name of `This` variables
#

# name, a property name, or any other name that's used to construct an internal

# -------------------------------------------------------
# Stacks
# -------------------------------------------------------
#
# All the stack manipulation operations are implemented as macros. In short,
# this is a consequence of the brain-dead CMake scoping limitations. These
# operations are called by the `body` parts of `commence` and `conclude`, which
# are defined as functions (that requirement coming from a different CMake
# limitation). List operations only work on local-scope variables (yet another
# limitation), so to have push/pop on the global stack, the local values need
# to be propagated. Propagation, though, only goes up a single level. By
# defining these as macros and calling them *only* from the body functions,
# we can have operations on the top-level stack variables.

# The `This` prefix
# -------------------------------------------------------
#
# `This` is a prefix for constructing environment-scoped values. There's no such
# thing as an environment scope in CMake, at least natively, so we have to
# create it. We do this as follows:
# - during commence()
#   - create a unique name to assign to `This`
#   - push that name onto the "this" stack
#   - assign the name to `This`
#   - assign the empty string to `${This}` in parent scope (creates variable)
#   - call the begin-hook
# - during conclude()
#   - call the end-hook
#   - pop the "this"" stack
#   - reset `This` from the popped value
# Both the begin-hook and the end-hook may rely on an initialized `This` value,
# in particular to use property services.

#
# The environment-specific variable. It's not set either (1) outside an
# environment or (2) inside of an erroneous `commence` block
#

# -------------------------------------------------------
# commence() and conclude()
# -------------------------------------------------------
#
# commence() and conclude() are implemented as macros so that they may
# introduce context-dependent variables into scope of the block. CMake does not
# provide such a scoping mechanism, so we have to create one ourselves. Because
# we're using a macro(), there arises an issue with error handling. There are
# three kinds of possibilities: (1) we can have every error be a fatal error and
# immediately terminate, (2) we can have deeply nested `if` blocks in sequence,
# or (3) we can put most of the operations into functions and explicitly keep
# track of error state so that we can define all expected variables, even if
# they don't have useful values. We'll be doing mostly (3) with a bit of (2) and
# (1) as appropriate.
#
# A critical point about the use of `function` here is that anything that the
# environment sees has to be set in the parent scope. This leads not only to
# a lot of syntax cruft, but also a need to pay particular attention to how
# subroutines are defined. Some functions are specifically designated to be
# called from these functions *only*. They set variables in parent scope and
# correct operation requires that they be invoked exactly one function-scope in
# from the directory scope.

# Environment Properties
# -------------------------------------------------------
#
# Properties are, underneath it all, variables whose names are constructed
# rather than constant. The names of environment properties are built up thus:
# - The `This` variable, which is a constant prefix and a unique counter value
# - The keyword "Property", to distinguish user-defined properties
# - The property name
#
# Can't use this syntax, because there's no variable scope
#     set_property(VARIABLE ${This} PROPERTY name "")

#
# Set a property value.
# - If there is no argument, the property is set to the empty string
# - If there is one argument, the property is set to that
# - If there is more than one argument, the property is set to a list
#   constructed from the arguments
