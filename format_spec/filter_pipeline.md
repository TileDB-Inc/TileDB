# Filter Pipeline

## Main Structure

The filter pipeline has internal format:

| **Field** | **Type** | **Description** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Max chunk size | `uint32_t` | Maximum chunk size within a tile |
| Num filters | `uint32_t` | Number of filters in pipeline |
| Filter 1 | [Filter](#filter) | First filter |
| … | … | … |
| Filter N | [Filter](#filter) | Nth filter |

For var size data, the filter pipeline tries to fit integral cells in a chunk. It uses the following heuristic if the cell doesn't fit:
  - If the chunk is not yet at 50% capacity, add the cell to the current chunk.
  - If the chunk is over 50% capacity and adding the cell would make it less than 150% of the maximum chunk size, add it to this chunk.
  - Else, start a new chunk.

## Filter

The filter has internal format:

| **Field** | **Type** | **Description** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Filter type | `uint8_t` | Type of filter \(e.g. `TILEDB_FILTER_BZIP2`\) |
| Filter metadata size | `uint32_t` | Number of bytes in filter metadata — may be 0. |
| Filter metadata | [Filter Metadata](#filter-metadata) | Filter metadata, specific to each filter. E.g. compression level for compression filters. |

## Filter Options

The filter options are configuration parameters for the filters that do not change once the array schema has been created. 

### Main Compressor Options

For the compression filters \(any of the filter types `TILEDB_FILTER_{GZIP,ZSTD,LZ4,RLE,BZIP2,DOUBLE_DELTA}`\) the filter options have internal format:

| **Field** | **Type** | **Description** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Compressor type | `uint8_t` | Type of compression \(e.g. `TILEDB_BZIP2`\) |
| Compression level | `int32_t` | Compression level used \(ignored by some compressors\). |

### Bit-width Reduction Options

The filter options for `TILEDB_FILTER_BIT_WIDTH_REDUCTION` has internal format:

| **Field** | **Type** | **Description** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Max window size | `uint32_t` | Maximum window size in bytes |

### Positive Delta Options

The filter options for `TILEDB_FILTER_POSITIVE_DELTA` has internal format:

| **Field** | **Type** | **Description** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Max window size | `uint32_t` | Maximum window size in bytes |

### Other Filter Options

The remaining filters \(`TILEDB_FILTER_{BITSHUFFLE,BYTESHUFFLE,CHECKSUM_MD5,CHECKSUM_256}` do not serialize any options.
