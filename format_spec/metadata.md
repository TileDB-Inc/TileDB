# Metadata

## Main Structure

The metadata is a folder called `__meta` located here:

```
my_array                            # array folder
   |  ...
   |_ __meta                        # metadata folder
         |_ <timestamped_name>      # metadata file
         |_ ...  
         |_ <timestamped_name>.vac  # vacuum file
         |_ ...  
```

`<timestamped_name>` has format `__t1_t2_uuid_v`, where:
* `t1` and `t2` are timestamps in milliseconds elapsed since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 +0000 (UTC)
* `uuid` is a unique identifier
* `v` is the format version

The metadata folder can contain:
* Any number of [metadata files](#array-metadata-file)
* Any number of [vacuum files](./vacuum_file.md)
