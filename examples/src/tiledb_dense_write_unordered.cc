 * @section DESCRIPTION
 *
 * It shows how to write random (unordered) cells to a dense array.
 *
 * Make sure that there is no directory named "my_dense_array" in your
 * current working directory.
 *
 * You need to run the following to make this work:
 *
 * ./tiledb_dense_create
 * ./tiledb_dense_write_unordered
