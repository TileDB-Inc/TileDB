 *
 * @section DESCRIPTION
 *
 * It shows how to write to a dense subarray, providing the array cells ordered
 * in row-major order within the specified subarray. TileDB will properly
 * re-organize the cells into the global cell order, prior to writing them
 * on the disk.
 *
 * Make sure that there is no directory named `my_dense_array` in your
 * current working directory.
 *
 * You need to run the following to make it work:
 *
 * ./tiledb_dense_create_cpp
 * ./tiledb_dense_write_ordered_subarray_cpp
