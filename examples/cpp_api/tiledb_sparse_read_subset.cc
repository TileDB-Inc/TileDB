 * @section DESCRIPTION
 *
 * It shows how to read from a sparse array, constraining the read
 * to a specific subarray and a subset of attributes. Moreover, the
 * program shows how to handle incomplete queries that did not complete
 * because the input buffers were not big enough to hold the entire
 * result.
 *
 * You need to run the following to make it work:
 *
 * $ ./tiledb_sparse_create_cpp
 * $ ./tiledb_sparse_write_global_1_cpp
 * $ ./tiledb_sparse_read_subset_cpp
