 * @section DESCRIPTION
 *
 * It shows how to write a dense subarray in the global cell order.
 * Make sure that there is not directory named `my_dense_array` in your current
 * working directory.
 *
 * You need to run the following to make this work:
 *
 * ./tiledb_dense_create_cpp
 * ./tiledb_dense_write_global_subarray_cpp
