 * @section DESCRIPTION
 *
 * This example shows how to write an entire dense array in a single write. It
 * is assumed that the user knows the global cell order and provides the values
 * to TileDB in that order.
 *
 * You need to run the following to make this work:
 *
 * ```
 * $ ./tiledb_dense_create_c
 * $ ./tiledb_dense_write_global_1_c
 * ```
 *
 * The created array looks as shown in figure
 * `<TileDB-repo>/examples/figures/dense_contents.png`
