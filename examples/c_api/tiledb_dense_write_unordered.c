 *
 * @section DESCRIPTION
 *
 * This example shows how to write random (unordered) cells to a dense array.
 *
 * Make sure that there is no directory named `my_dense_array` in your
 * current working directory.
 *
 * You need to run the following to make this work:
 *
 * ```
 * $ ./tiledb_dense_create_c
 * $ ./tiledb_dense_write_unordered_c
 * ```
 *
 * The above will create a fragment that looks as in figure
 * `<TileDB-repo>/examples/figures/dense_write_unordered.png`.
