 * @section DESCRIPTION
 *
 * This example shows how to populate an entire array using two write queries,
 * confirming that the write query maintains some state. It is again assumed
 * that the user knows the global cell order and provides the values to
 * TileDB in that order.
 *
 * You need to run the following to make this work:
 *
 * ```
 * $ ./tiledb_dense_create_c
 * $ ./tiledb_dense_write_global_2_c
 * ```
 *
 * The resulting array is identical to that in example
 * `tiledb_dense_write_global_1.c`. Moreover, note that there is a
 * **single fragment** produced; the second write essentially **appends**
 * to the existing fragment.
