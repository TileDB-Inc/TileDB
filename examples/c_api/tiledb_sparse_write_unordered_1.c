 * @section DESCRIPTION
 *
 * This example shows how to write unordered cells to a sparse array in a
 * single write. Now there is no assumption that the user know the global cell
 * order, so the cells are given in a random order.
 *
 * You need to run the following to make this work:
 *
 * ```
 * $ ./tiledb_sparse_create_c
 * $ ./tiledb_sparse_write_unordered_1_c
 * ```
 *
 * The resulting array is identical to that in `tiledb_spare_write_global_1.c`.
