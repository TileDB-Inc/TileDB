 * @section DESCRIPTION
 *
 * This example shows how to read from a sparse array, constraining the read
 * to a specific subarray and a subset of attributes. Moreover, the
 * program shows how to handle queries that did not complete
 * because the input buffers were not big enough to hold the entire
 * result.
 *
 * You need to run the following to make it work:
 *
 * ```
 * $ ./tiledb_sparse_create_c
 * $ ./tiledb_sparse_write_global_1_c
 * $ ./tiledb_sparse_read_subset_c
 * a1
 * ---
 * 5
 * 6
 * 7
 * ```
 *
 * The query returns the subarray depicted in blue in figure
 * `<TileDB-repo>/examples/figures/sparse_subarray.png`.
 *
 * The program prints the cell values of `a1` in the subarray in column-major
 * order.
