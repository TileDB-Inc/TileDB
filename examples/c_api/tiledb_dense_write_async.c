 *
 * @section DESCRIPTION
 *
 * It shows how to write asynchronoulsy to a dense array. The case of sparse
 * arrays is similar.
 *
 * You need to run the following to make this work:
 *
 * ```
 * $ ./tiledb_dense_create_c
 * # ./tiledb_dense_write_async_c
 * Query in progress
 * Callback: Query completed
 * ```
 *
 * Observe that `Query in progress` is printed out first and then the main
 * function waits for TileDB to process the query. When the query is completed,
 * the callback function is called, which prints `Query completed`.
