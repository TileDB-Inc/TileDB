 *
 * @section DESCRIPTION
 *
 * This example shows how to write to a dense subarray, providing the array
 * cells ordered in row-major order within the specified subarray. TileDB will
 * properly re-organize the cells into the global cell order, prior to writing
 * them on the disk.
 *
 * Make sure that there is no directory named `my_dense_array` in your
 * current working directory.
 *
 * You need to run the following to make it work:
 *
 * ```
 * $ ./tiledb_dense_create_c
 * $ ./tiledb_dense_write_ordered_subarray_c
 * ```
 *
 * The above will create a fragment that looks as in figure
 * `<TileDB-repo>/examples/figures/dense_write_ordered_subarray.png`.
