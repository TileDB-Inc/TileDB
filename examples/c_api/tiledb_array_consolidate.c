 * @section DESCRIPTION
 *
 * This program shows how to consolidate arrays.
 *
 * One way to make this work is by first creating a dense array and making three
 * different writes:
 *
 * ```
 * $ ./tiledb_dense_create_c
 * $ ./tiledb_dense_write_global_1_c
 * $ ./tiledb_dense_write_global_subarray_c
 * $ ./tiledb_dense_write_unordered_c
 * $ ls -1 my_dense_array
 * __0x7ffff10e73c0_1517941950491
 * __0x7ffff10e73c0_1517941954698
 * __0x7ffff10e73c0_1517941959273
 * __array_schema.tdb
 * __lock.tdb
 * ```
 *
 * The above will create three fragments (appearing as separate subdirectories).
 *
 * Running this program will consolidate the 3 fragments/directories into a
 * single one.
 *
 * ```
 * $ ./tiledb_array_consolidate_c
 * $ ls -1 my_dense_array
 * __0x7ffff10e73c0_1517941970634_1517941959273
 * __lock.tdb
 * __array_schema.tdb
 * ```
