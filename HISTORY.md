# TileDB v2.24.0 Release Notes

## Deprecation announcements

In version 2.26.0, the superbuild architecture of the build system will be removed and TileDB will become a single-level CMake project with no CMake sub-build for libtiledb after dependencies are built (as of TileDB 2.24, dependencies are built at configuration time with vcpkg). `make install-tiledb` will continue to work, but will become effectively an alias for `make install`, which will always produce an up-to-date install after this change. Other build commands of the form `make && make -C tiledb <targets>` will have to be replaced by `make <targets>`. You can preview the effects of this change by configuring with CMake and passing the -DTILEDB_CMAKE_IDE=ON option.

## Configuration changes

# TileDB v2.14.0 Release Notes

## Announcements

* TileDB 2.17, targeted for release in April 2023, will require C++20 support for full library compilation.
  C++17 compatibility will be maintained in the public C++ API for several releases beyond 2.17.

## Disk Format

* Format version updated to 17. [#3611](https://github.com/TileDB-Inc/TileDB/pull/3611)

## Breaking API changes

* In TileDB 2.15, we will begin removing C and C++ API functions deprecated through TileDB 2.12. See [list of deprecated functions](doc/policy/api_changes.md#Deprecation-version-history).

## Breaking behavior

* For global order reads, an error is now raised if multiple ranges are set when the query is submitted. Previously, an error was raised immediately upon adding another range during subarray creation. [#3664](https://github.com/TileDB-Inc/TileDB/pull/3664)
* For dense writes, an error is now raised if multiple ranges are set when the query is submitted. Previously, an error was raised immediately upon adding another range during subarray creation. [#3664](https://github.com/TileDB-Inc/TileDB/pull/3664)
* For sparse writes, an error is now raised if the subarray is not default when the query is submitted. Previously, an error was raised when adding ranges to a subarray for a sparse write. [#3664](https://github.com/TileDB-Inc/TileDB/pull/3664)
* TileDB will not longer override the `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` or `AWS_REGION` environment variables, if set in the process environment. Previously, the library would unconditionally default to setting the region to "us-east-1" _unless_ the `vfs.s3.region` config variable was specified; now the library will check for the mentioned environment variables, and avoid setting a default if present. The `vfs.s3.region` config variable will still take precedence if provided [#3788](https://github.com/TileDB-Inc/TileDB/pull/3788)

## New features

* Add UTF-8 attribute binary comparison support for QueryConditions. [#3766](https://github.com/TileDB-Inc/TileDB/pull/3766)
* Add Boolean Support For Sparse Query Conditions. [#3651](https://github.com/TileDB-Inc/TileDB/pull/3651)

* Fix deserialize to set array_schema_all_ into array object [#3363](https://github.com/TileDB-Inc/TileDB/pull/3363)


# TileDB v2.11.0 Release Notes

## Disk Format
* Bump format version and remove config option for consolidation with timestamps [#3267](https://github.com/TileDB-Inc/TileDB/pull/3267)

## Breaking C API changes
* `tiledb_filter_alloc` no longer returns `TILEDB_OK` when passed a nullptr as the third argument. [#3222](https://github.com/TileDB-Inc/TileDB/pull/3222)

## Breaking behavior
* Enforce version upper bound for reads, [#3248](https://github.com/TileDB-Inc/TileDB/pull/3248).
  TileDB will no longer attempt to read an array written with a newer library version.
  This has never been officially supported, and in practice it usually leads to confusing errors
  due to format changes.
  *Backward read-compatibility is unaffected, and is tested for each release.*

## Potential change
* **If you have a use-case with tiles larger than 64 MB (in-memory), please get in touch.**
  In order to facilitate improved memory usage and i/o processing performance, we are
  considering a default upper-bound on tile size in a future version.

## New features
* Floating point scaling filter
 ([#3243](https://github.com/TileDB-Inc/TileDB/pull/3243),
 [#3083](https://github.com/TileDB-Inc/TileDB/pull/3083))
  * API Note: input parameters and compatibility with input data are currently unvalidated.
    This filter requires care in the selection of scale and offset factors compatible with
    the input data range.
* Support for overlapping ranges in QueryCondition. [#3264](https://github.com/TileDB-Inc/TileDB/pull/3264)
* Enable query condition on dimensions for sparse arrays. [#3302](https://github.com/TileDB-Inc/TileDB/pull/3302)

* Remove xlock in FragmentMetadata::store [#1639](https://github.com/TileDB-Inc/TileDB/pull/1639)

## API additions

# TileDB v2.0.0 Release Notes

## Disk Format

* Removed file `__coords.tdb` that stored the zipped coordinates in sparse fragments
* Now storing the coordinate tiles on each dimension in separate files
* Changed fragment name format from `__t1_t2_uuid` to `__t1_t2_uuid_<format_version>`. That was necessary for backwards compatibility

## Breaking C API changes

* Changed `domain` input of `tiledb_dimension_get_domain` to `const void**` (from `void**`).
* Changed `tile_extent` input of `tiledb_dimension_get_tile_extent` to `const void**` (from `void**`).
* Anonymous attribute and dimensions (i.e., empty strings for attribute/dimension names) is no longer supported. This is because now the user can set separate dimension buffers to the query and, therefore, supporting anonymous attributes and dimensions creates ambiguity in the current API.

## Breaking behavior

* Now the TileDB consolidation process does not clean up the fragments or array metadata it consolidates. This is (i) to avoid exclusively locking at any point during consolidation, and (ii) to enable fine-grained time traveling even in the presence of consolidated fragments or array metadata. Instead, we added a special vacuuming API which explicitly cleans up consolidated fragments or array metadata (with appropriate configuration parameters). The vacuuming functions briefly exclusively lock the array.

## New features

* Added string dimension support (currently only `TILEDB_STRING_ASCII`).
* The user can now set separate coordinate buffers to the query. Also any subset of the dimensions is supported.
* The user can set separate filter lists per dimension, as well as the number of values per coordinate.

## Improvements

* Added support for AWS Security Token Service session tokens via configuration option `vfs.s3.session_token`. [#1472](https://github.com/TileDB-Inc/TileDB/pull/1472)
* Added support for indicating zero-value metadata by returning `value_num` == 1 from the `_get_metadatata` and `Array::get_metadata` APIs [#1438](https://github.com/TileDB-Inc/TileDB/pull/1438) (this is a non-breaking change, as the documented return of `value == nullptr` to indicate missing keys does not change)`
* User can set coordinate buffers separately for write queries.
* Added option to enable duplicate coordinates for sparse arrays [#1504](https://github.com/TileDB-Inc/TileDB/pull/1504)
* Added support for writing at a timestamp by allowing opening an array at a timestamp (previously disabled).
* Added special files with the same name as a fragment directory and an added suffix ".ok", to indicate a committed fragment. This improved the performance of opening an array on object stores significantly, as it avoids an extra REST request per fragment.
* Added functionality to consolidation, which allows consolidating the fragment metadata footers in a single file by toggling a new config parameter. This leads to a huge performance boost when opening an array, as it avoids fetching a separate footer per fragment from storage.
* Various reader parallelizations that boosted read performance significantly.
* Configuration parameters can now be read from environmental variables. `vfs.s3.session_token` -> `TILEDB_VFS_S3_SESSION_TOKEN`. The prefix of `TILEDB_` is configurable via `config.env_var_prefix`. [#1600](https://github.com/TileDB-Inc/TileDB/pull/1600)

## Deprecations
* The TileDB tiledb_array_consolidate_metadata and tiledb_array_consolidate_metadata_with_key C-API routines have been deprecated and will be [removed entirely](https://github.com/TileDB-Inc/TileDB/issues/1591) in a future release. The tiledb_array_consolidate and tiledb_array_consolidate_with_key routines achieve the same behavior when the "sm.consolidation.mode" parameter of the configuration argument is equivalent to "array_meta".
* The TileDB Array::consolidate_metadata CPP-API routine has been deprecated and will be [removed entirely](https://github.com/TileDB-Inc/TileDB/issues/1591) in a future release. The Array::consolidate routine achieves the same behavior when the "sm.consolidation.mode" parameter of the configuration argument is equivalent to "array_meta".

## Bug fixes

* Fixed bug in dense consolidation when the array domain is not divisible by the tile extents.

## API additions

# TileDB v1.6.0 Release Notes

The 1.6.0 release adds the major new feature of non-continuous range slicing, as well as a number of stability and usability improvements. Support is also introduced for datetime dimensions and attributes.

## New features

* Added support for multi-range reads (non-continuous range slicing) for dense and sparse arrays.
* Added support for datetime domains and attributes.

## Improvements

* Removed fragment metadata caching. [#1197](https://github.com/TileDB-Inc/TileDB/pull/1197)
* Removed array schema caching. [#1197](https://github.com/TileDB-Inc/TileDB/pull/1197)
* The tile MBR in the in-memory fragment metadata are organized into an R-Tree, speeding up tile overlap operations during subarray reads. [#1197](https://github.com/TileDB-Inc/TileDB/pull/1197)
* Improved encryption key validation process when opening already open arrays. Fixes issue with indefinite growing of the URI to encryption key mapping in `StorageManager` (the mapping is no longer needed).  [#1197](https://github.com/TileDB-Inc/TileDB/pull/1197)
* Improved dense write performance in some benchmarks. [#1229](https://github.com/TileDB-Inc/TileDB/pull/1229)
* Support for direct writes without using the S3 multi-part API. Allows writing to
  Google Cloud Storage S3 compatibility mode. [#1219](https://github.com/TileDB-Inc/TileDB/pull/1219)
* Removed 256-character length limit from URIs. [#1288](https://github.com/TileDB-Inc/TileDB/pull/1288)
* Dense reads and writes now always require a subarray to be set, to avoid confusion. [#1320](https://github.com/TileDB-Inc/TileDB/pull/1320)
* Added query and array schema serialization API. [#1262](https://github.com/TileDB-Inc/TileDB/pull/1262)

# TileDB v1.4.0 Release Notes

The 1.4.0 release brings two new major features, attribute filter lists and at-rest array encryption, along with bugfixes and performance improvements.

**Note:** TileDB v1.4.0 changes the on-disk array format. Existing arrays should be re-written using TileDB v1.4.0 before use. Starting from v1.4.0 and on, backwards compatibility for reading old-versioned arrays will be fully supported.

## New features

* All array data can now be encrypted at rest using AES-256-GCM symmetric encryption. [#968](https://github.com/TileDB-Inc/TileDB/pull/968)
* Negative and real-valued domain types are now fully supported. [#885](https://github.com/TileDB-Inc/TileDB/pull/885)
* New filter API for transforming attribute data with an ordered list of filters. [#912](https://github.com/TileDB-Inc/TileDB/pull/912)
* Current filters include: previous compressors, bit width reduction, bitshuffle, byteshuffle, and positive-delta encoding.
    * The bitshuffle filter uses an implementation by [Kiyoshi Masui](https://github.com/kiyo-masui/bitshuffle).
    * The byteshuffle filter uses an implementation by [Francesc Alted](https://github.com/Blosc/c-blosc) (from the Blosc project).
* Arrays can now be opened at specific timestamps. [#984](https://github.com/TileDB-Inc/TileDB/pull/984)

## Deprecations

* The C and C++ APIs for compression have been deprecated. The corresponding filter API should be used instead. The compression API will be removed in a future TileDB version. [#1008](https://github.com/TileDB-Inc/TileDB/pull/1008)
* Removed Blosc compressors (obviated by byteshuffle -> compressor filter list).

## Bug fixes

* Fix issue where performing a read query with empty result could cause future reads to return empty [#882](https://github.com/TileDB-Inc/TileDB/pull/882)
* Fix TBB initialization bug with multiple contexts [#898](https://github.com/TileDB-Inc/TileDB/pull/898)
* Fix bug in max buffer sizes estimation [#903](https://github.com/TileDB-Inc/TileDB/pull/903)
* Fix Buffer allocation size being incorrectly set on realloc [#911](https://github.com/TileDB-Inc/TileDB/pull/911)

## Improvements

* Added check if the coordinates fall out-of-bounds (i.e., outside the array domain) during sparse writes, and added config param `sm.check_coord_oob` to enable/disable the check (enabled by default). [#996](https://github.com/TileDB-Inc/TileDB/pull/996)
* Add config params `sm.num_reader_threads` and `sm.num_writer_threads` for separately controlling I/O parallelism from compression parallelism.
* Added contribution guidelines [#899](https://github.com/TileDB-Inc/TileDB/pull/899)
* Enable building TileDB in Cygwin environment on Windows [#890](https://github.com/TileDB-Inc/TileDB/pull/890)
* Added a simple benchmarking script and several benchmark programs [#889](https://github.com/TileDB-Inc/TileDB/pull/889)
* Changed C API and disk format integer types to have explicit bit widths. [#981](https://github.com/TileDB-Inc/TileDB/pull/981)

## API additions

### C API

* Added `Attribute::filter_list()`, `Attribute::set_filter_list()`, `ArraySchema::coords_filter_list()`, `ArraySchema::set_coords_filter_list()`, `ArraySchema::offsets_filter_list()`, `ArraySchema::set_offsets_filter_list()` functions.
* Added overloads for `Array()`, `Array::open()`, `Map()`, `Map::open()` for handling timestamps.

## Breaking changes

### C API

* Removed Blosc compressors.
* Removed `tiledb_kv_set_max_buffered_items`.
* Modified `tiledb_kv_open` to not take an attribute subselection, but instead take as input the
query type (similar to arrays). This makes the key-value store behave similarly to arrays,
which means that the key-value store does not support interleaved reads/writes any more
(an opened key-value store is used either for reads or writes, but not both).
* `tiledb_kv_close` does not flush the written items. Instead, `tiledb_kv_flush` must be
invoked explicitly.

### C++ API

* Removed Blosc compressors.
* Removed `Map::set_max_buffered_items`.
* Modified `Map::Map` and `Map::open` to not take an attribute subselection, but instead take as input the

* Added `MapSchema::set_capacity` and `MapSchema::capacity`
* Support for trivially copyable objects, such as a custom data struct, was added. They will be backed by an `sizeof(T)` sized `char` attribute.
* `Attribute::create<T>` can now be used with compound `T`, such as `std::string` and `std::vector<T>`, and other
  objects such as a simple data struct.
* Added a `Dimension::create` factory function that does not take tile extent,
  which sets the tile extent to `NULL`.
* `tiledb::Attribute` can now be constructed with an enumerated type (e.x. `TILEDB_CHAR`).
* Added `Stats` class (wraps C API `tiledb_stats_*` functions)
* Added `Config::save_to_file`

## Breaking changes

### C API

* `tiledb_query_finalize` must **always** be called before `tiledb_query_free` after global-order writes.
* Removed `tiledb_vfs_move` and added `tiledb_vfs_move_file` and `tiledb_vfs_move_dir` instead.
* Removed `force` argument from `tiledb_vfs_move_*` and `tiledb_object_move`.
* Removed `vfs.s3.file_buffer_size` config parameter.
* Removed `tiledb_query_get_attribute_status`.
* All `tiledb_*_free` functions now return `void` and do not take `ctx` as input (except for `tiledb_ctx_free`).
* Changed signature of `tiledb_kv_close` to take a `tiledb_kv_t*` argument instead of `tiledb_kv_t**`.
* Renamed `tiledb_domain_get_rank` to `tiledb_domain_get_ndim` to avoid confusion with matrix def of rank.
* Changed signature of `tiledb_array_get_non_empty_domain`.
* Removed `tiledb_array_compute_max_read_buffer_sizes`.
* Changed signature of `tiledb_{array,kv}_open`.
* Removed `tiledb_kv_iter_create`
* Renamed all C API functions that create TileDB objects from `tiledb_*_create` to `tiledb_*_alloc`.
* Removed `tiledb_query_set_buffers`
* Removed `tiledb_query_reset_buffers`
* Added query type argument to `tiledb_array_open`
* Changed argument order in `tiledb_config_iter_alloc`, `tiledb_ctx_alloc`, `tiledb_attribute_alloc`, `tiledb_dimension_alloc`, `tiledb_array_schema_alloc`, `tiledb_kv_schema_load`, `tiledb_kv_get_item`, `tiledb_vfs_alloc`

### C++ API

* Fixes with `Array::max_buffer_elements` and `Query::result_buffer_elements` to comply with the API docs. `pair.first` is the number of elements of the offsets buffer. If `pair.first` is 0, it is a fixed-sized attribute or coordinates.
* `std::array<T, N>` is backed by a `char` tiledb attribute since the size is not guaranteed.
* Headers have the `tiledb_cpp_api_` prefix removed. For example, the include is now `#include <tiledb/attribute.h>`
* Removed `VFS::move` and added `VFS::move_file` and `VFS::move_dir` instead.
* Removed `force` argument from `VFS::move_*` and `Object::move`.
* Removed `vfs.s3.file_buffer_size` config parameter.
* `Query::finalize` must **always** be called before going out of scope after global-order writes.
* Removed `Query::attribute_status`.
* The API was made header only to improve cross-platform compatibility. `config_iter.h`, `filebuf.h`, `map_item.h`, `map_iter.h`, and `map_proxy.h` are no longer available, but grouped into the headers of the objects they support.
* Previously a `tiledb::Map` could be created from a `std::map`, an anonymous attribute name was defined. This must now be explicitly defined: `tiledb::Map::create(tiledb::Context, std::string uri, std::map, std::string attr_name)`
* Removed `tiledb::Query::reset_buffers`. Any previous usages can safely be removed.
* `Map::begin` refers to the same iterator object. For multiple concurrent iterators, a `MapIter` should be manually constructed instead of using `Map::begin()` more than once.
* Renamed `Domain::rank` to `Domain::ndim` to avoid confusion with matrix def of rank.
* Added query type argument to `Array` constructor
* Removed iterator functionality from `Map`.
* Removed `Array::parition_subarray`.

# TileDB v1.2.0 Release Notes
The 1.2.0 release of TileDB includes many new features, improvements in stability and performance, and two new language interfaces (Python and C++). There are also several breaking changes in the C API and on-disk format, documented below.

**Important Note**: due to several improvements and changes in the underlying array storage mechanism, you will need to recreate any existing arrays in order to use them with TileDB v1.2.0.

## New features
* Windows support. TileDB is now fully supported on Windows systems (64-bit Windows 7 and newer).
* Python API. We are very excited to announce the initial release of a Python API for TileDB. The Python API makes TileDB accessible to a much broader audience, allowing seamless integration with existing Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas and the scientific Python ecosystem.
* C++ API. We've included a C++ API, which allows TileDB to integrate into modern C++ applications without having to write code towards the C API.  The C++ API is more concise and provides additional compile time type safety.
* S3 object store support. You can now easily store, query, and manipulate your TileDB arrays on S3 API compatibile object stores, including Amazon's AWS S3 service.
* Virtual filesystem interface. The TileDB API now exposes a virtual filesystem (or VFS) interface, allowing you to perform tasks such as file creation, deletion, reads, and appends without worrying about whether your files are stored on S3, HDFS, a POSIX or Windows filesystem, etc.
* Key-value store. TileDB now provides a key-value (meta) data storage abstraction.  Its implementation is built upon TileDB's sparse arrays and inherits all the properties of TileDB sparse arrays.

## Improvements
* Homebrew formula added for easier installation on macOS.  Homebrew is now the perferred method for installing TileDB and its dependencies on macOS.
* Docker images updated to include stable/unstable/dev options, and easy configuration of additional components (e.g. S3 support).
* Tile cache implemented, which will greatly speed up repeated queries on overlapping regions of the same array.
* Ability to pass runtime configuration arguments to TileDB/VFS backends.
* Unnamed (or "anonymous") dimensions are now supported; having a single anonymous attribute is also supported.
* Concurrency bugfixes for several compressors.
* Correctness issue fixed in double-delta compressor for some datatypes.
* Better build behavior on systems with older GCC or CMake versions.
* Several memory leaks and overruns fixed with help of sanitizers.
* Many improved error condition checks and messages for easier debugging.
* Many other small bugs and API inconsistencies fixed.

## C API additions
* `tiledb_config_*`:  Types and functions related to the new configuration object and functionality.
* `tiledb_config_iter_*`: Iteration functionality for retieving parameters/values from the new configuration object.
* `tiledb_ctx_get_config()`: Function to get a configuration from a context.
* `tiledb_filesystem_t`: Filesystem type enum.
* `tiledb_ctx_is_supported_fs()`: Function to check for support for a given filesystem backend.
* `tiledb_error_t`, `tiledb_error_message()` and `tiledb_error_free()`: Type and functions for TileDB error messages.
* `tiledb_ctx_get_last_error()`: Function to get last error from context.
* `tiledb_domain_get_rank()`: Function to retrieve number of dimensions in a domain.
* `tiledb_domain_get_dimension_from_index()` and `tiledb_domain_get_dimension_from_name()`: Replaces dimension iterators.
* `tiledb_dimension_{create,free,get_name,get_type,get_domain,get_tile_extent}()`: Functions related to creation and manipulation of `tiledb_dimension_t` objects.
* `tiledb_array_schema_set_coords_compressor()`: Function to set the coordinates compressor.
* `tiledb_array_schema_set_offsets_compressor()`: Function to set the offsets compressor.
* `tiledb_array_schema_get_attribute_{num,from_index,from_name}()`: Replaces attribute iterators.
* `tiledb_query_create()`: Replaced many arguments with new `tiledb_query_set_*()` setter functions.
* `tiledb_array_get_non_empty_domain()`: Function to retrieve the non-empty domain from an array.
* `tiledb_array_compute_max_read_buffer_sizes()`: Function to compute an upper bound on the buffer sizes required for a read query.
* `tiledb_object_ls()`: Function to visit the children of a path.
* `tiledb_uri_to_path()`: Function to convert a file:// URI to a platform-native path.
* `TILEDB_MAX_PATH` and `tiledb_max_path()`: The maximum length for tiledb resource paths.
* `tiledb_kv_*`: Types and functions related to the new key-value store functionality.
* `tiledb_vfs_*`: Types and functions related to the new virtual filesystem (VFS) functionality.

## Breaking changes

### C API
* Rename `tiledb_array_metadata_t` -> `tiledb_array_schema_t`, and associated `tiledb_array_metadata_*` functions to `tiledb_array_schema_*`.
* Remove `tiledb_attribute_iter_t`.
* Remove `tiledb_dimension_iter_t`.
* Rename `tiledb_delete()`, `tiledb_move()`, `tiledb_walk()` to `tiledb_object_{delete,move,walk}()`.
* `tiledb_ctx_create`: Config argument added.
* `tiledb_domain_create`: Datatype argument removed.
* `tiledb_domain_add_dimension`: Name, domain and tile extent arguments replaced with single `tiledb_dimension_t` argument.
* `tiledb_query_create()`: Replaced many arguments with new `tiledb_query_set_*()` setter functions.
* `tiledb_array_create()`: Added array URI argument.
* `tiledb_*_free()`: All free functions now take a pointer to the object pointer instead of simply object pointer.
* The include files are now installed into a `tiledb` folder. The correct path is now `#include <tiledb/tiledb.h>` (or `#include <tiledb/tiledb>` for the C++ API).

### Resource Management
* Support for moving resources across previous VFS backends (local fs <-> HDFS) has been removed.  A more generic implementation for this functionality with improved performance is planned for the next version of TileDB.
