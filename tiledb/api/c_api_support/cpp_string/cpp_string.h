/**
 * Validate that a pointer is to a C-style string and convert it to a string
 * view.
 *
 * This function is a defense against malformed inputs coming in through the C
 * API. This function validates the following properties of the candidate input:
 *   - The pointer is not null. (It points to something.)
 *   - The string is null-terminated. (It has a length.)
 *   - The string length is admissible. (It's short enough.)
 * The admissible string length might vary depending on how it's being used.
 *
 * This function does not throw. It returns an empty string if there's a
 * validation error.
 *
 * @section Maturity
 *
 * There's one failure that this function cannot withstand at present. If the
 * pointer is to a non-terminated string at the end of a page, there will be an
 * access violation fault that necessarily happens during the search for a
 * terminating NUL character. It would be possible to recover from such an error
 * by catching the resulting signal and causing this function to simply return
 * false. This behavior, however, is not nearly as simple as it might appear.
 *
 * The proper requirement for such behavior is that it be able to deal with
 * multiple simultaneous invocations of the function. As this function is
 * defensive, it should be able to handle many simultaneous calls correctly, as
 * an intentional attacker might generate them specifically with an eye to
 * cause the defense to fault.
 *
 * @param candidate_c_string A pointer to be validated as a null-terminated
 *   character string
 * @return A string view corresponding to the candidate if it is valid. A null
 *   string view (`.data() == nullptr`) otherwise.
