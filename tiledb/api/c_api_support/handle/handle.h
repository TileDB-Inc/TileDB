/*
 * API Handles
 *
 * The C API present its objects with pointers to opaque `struct` objects. The
 * existing (legacy) policy has been manual allocation these `struct` (using
 * `tdb_new`) and returning the pointer. Implementing such a pattern with
 * smart pointers presents a challenge. On one hand, some external function
 * needs to allocate such an object, because we need a pointer to the object,
 * not just the object itself. On the other hand, the allocation must also be,
 * in some sense, inside the object, because we need to rely on its destructor
 * to release the allocation.
 *
 * Furthermore, any object that points to itself is at risk of becoming a memory
 * leak. This is not an obstacle, but rather a criterion for success. Because we
 * are using arbitrary C function calls to govern the lifespan of an object, any
 * means that does not keep itself in existence without a C++ object referencing
 * it cannot be a possible solution.
 *
 * Hence, the base handle class satisfies this requirement thus:
 *
 * 1. All handles are constructed by factory functions that perform the
 * initial allocation.
 * 2. `Handle` stores a `shared_ptr` to itself. This is similar to what
 * `std::enable_shared_from_this` does, but we want a `shared_ptr` always
 * stored, rather than the `weak_ptr` that `shared_from_this` uses.
 *
 * A handle instance, even if constructed as a temporary variable, will persist
 * in memory indefinitely. Only when it's explicitly reset will it deallocate.
 *
 * The analogy to `enable_shared_from_this` is closer than it might seem. That
 * class is a base class with a `weak_ptr` that's initialized to any
 * `shared_ptr` that's constructed with that base class. We don't have any
 * ability to change the `shared_ptr` constructor to do what we want, so we are
 * settling for something a bit clunkier: mandatory factory construction.
