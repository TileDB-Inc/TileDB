# Subdirectories
#
# We need to include directories in an order compatible with their dependency
# relationships. The comments below are all the explicit dependencies. The
# transitive dependencies generally contain redundancies with the explicit ones;
# we do not take that as an excuse to omit them.
#
# Dependency Rule: Section `A` depends on section `B` if an API call in section
# `A` uses a handle defined in section `B`. For example, most of the C API
# depends on `context`, as context handles are often the first argument.
#

# `error`: no dependencies

# `config`: depends on `error`

# `context`: depends on `config`
