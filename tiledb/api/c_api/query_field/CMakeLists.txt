# The object library `capi_query_field` cannot be linked standalone at the
# present time. It depends upon member functions of `class Query`, which does
# not yet have a standalone object library of its own. Without such a
# dependency, `capi_query_field` would have to link (essentially) the whole 
# library to get a complete executable.
# 
# It is against policy to use the `object_library` environment to define object
# libraries that cannot stand alone. Therefore this definition is directly in
# CMake and does not include a link-completeness target.
