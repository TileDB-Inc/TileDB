 * Visits the children of `path` recursively, invoking the callback for each
 * entry. The callback should return 1 to continue traversal, 0 to stop, or -1
 * on error. The callback is responsible for writing gathered entries into the
 * `data` buffer, for example using a pointer to a user-defined struct.
 *
 * Currently only S3 is supported, and the `path` must be a valid S3 URI.
 *
 * **Example:**
 *
 * @code{.c}
 * int my_callback(
 *     const char* path, size_t path_length, uint64_t file_size, void* data) {
 *   MyCbStruct cb_data = static_cast<MyCbStruct*>(data);
 *   // Perform custom callback behavior here.
 *   return 1;  // Continue traversal to next entry.
 * }
 * MyCbStruct* cb_data = allocate_cb_struct();
 *
 * tiledb_vfs_ls_recursive(ctx, vfs, "s3://bucket/foo", my_callback, &cb_data);
 * @endcode
 *
 * @param[in] ctx The TileDB context.
 * @param[in] vfs The virtual filesystem object.
 * @param[in] path The path in which the traversal will occur.
 * @param[in] callback
 * The callback function to be applied on every visited object.
 *     The callback should return `0` if the iteration must stop, and `1`
 *     if the iteration must continue. It takes as input the currently visited
 *     path, the length of the currently visited path, the size of the file, and
 *     user provided buffer for paths and object sizes in the form of a struct
 *     pointer. The callback returns `-1` upon error. Note that `path` in the
 *     callback will be an **absolute** path.
 * @param[in] data Data pointer passed into the callback for storing results.
 * @return `TILEDB_OK` for success and `TILEDB_ERR` for error.
