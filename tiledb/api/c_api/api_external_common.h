/*
 * Policy: Visible API calls may not throw exceptions.
 * Problem: We can't specify that in C.
 * Solution: A macro that specifies it for C++ and elides it for C
 *
 * `TILEDB_NOEXCEPT` usage:
 * 1. Header files that may appear in C programs (such as tiledb.h) must use the
 *    macro because we require API entry points not to throw. They're defined
 *    with `noexcept` in C++ definitions, and so the declaration must match, but
 *    a C declaration must omit that keyword.
 * 2. Definitions of C API entry point functions must have `noexcept` and not
 *    use the macro. These functions are compiled only as C++. They don't need
 *    the macro and we omit it for clarity. These functions are wrapped versions
 *    of API implementation functions, and the wrapper provides the `noexcept`
 *    guarantee.
 * 3. Implementation functions should not be declared noexcept. They have no way
 *    of providing uniform error handling and should defer to the wrapper for
 *    that.
 *
 * tl;dr: Only use the macro in headers for "C" code.
