/**
 * Handle `struct` for API filter list objects.
 *
 * This class has responsibility for maintaining an allocation. For practical
 * reasons, detailed below, its constructor takes a pointer to allocated
 * memory. This is part of a much larger implementation pattern. Filters are
 * stored within `FilterPipeline` as `shared_ptr<Filter>`, but these are
 * initialized with with directly allocations.
 *
 * Existing (legacy) implementation pattern:
 *   - Calls `tdb_new` to allocate filters
 *   - Calls `delete` to release allocation
 *   - Calls `Filter::clone` to copy filters
 *     - `Filter::clone` calls virtual `Filter::clone_impl`; these functions
 *       call `new` or `tdb_new` internally
 *   - Calls `FilterPipeline::add_filter` to build a filter list
 *     - which calls `Filter::clone` internally and uses the value to
 *       initialize `shared_ptr`
 *
 * Changing this will be extensive, although not particularly difficult:
 *   - Store `shared_ptr<Filter>` in the API handle
 *   - Call `make_shared` to allocate filters and release allocations
 *   - Eliminate `Filter::clone`
 *   - Add `FilterPipeline::add_filter` that takes `shared_ptr` argument
 *     - copied into argument, moved from argument
 *   - Add `FilterPipeline::add_filter` that takes a filter rvalue
 *     - must be templated to capture subclass
 *     - `make_shared` with move constructor from argument
 *   - Change `FilterCreate::make` to return `shared_ptr`
 *
 * Changing this will not require changes to deserialization, either from
 * storage or from network. These functions call `make_shared` with constructor
 * arguments (C.41-complaint).
