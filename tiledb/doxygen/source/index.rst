====================

TileDB is a data management solution invented to help Data Science teams make
faster discoveries, by giving them a more natural way to store, analyze and
share large sets of diverse data, so that they can stop wasting time working
around performance limitations, inadequate data storage formats, and unfamiliar
tooling.
