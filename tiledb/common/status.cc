 * @section DESCRIPTION
 *
 * A Status object encapsulates the result of an operation.  It may indicate
 * success, or it may indicate an error with an associated error message.
 *
 * Multiple threads can invoke const methods on a Status without
 * external synchronization, but if any of the threads may call a
 * non-const method, all threads accessing the same Status must use
 * external synchronization.
