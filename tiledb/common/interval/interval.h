 * @section DESCRIPTION
 *
 * This file defines classes for set-theoretic intervals. The operations are
 * standard ones on sets: intersection, union (where defined), partial ordering,
 * etc. Intervals are defined for any totally ordered set. All integral and
 * floating-point types are totally ordered, but so also are strings of totally
 * ordered symbols. In particular, no arithmetic operations such as addition are
 * assumed. For this sense, see
 *      https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(mathematics)
 *
 * To avoid confusion, there is another, different use for intervals that is
 * prevalent, which is to use interval arithmetic to represent error bounds.
 * This not the purpose here. For this other sense, see
 *      https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_arithmetic
 *
 * Three foundational kinds of intervals are from integral types, floating point
 * types, and strings.
 *
 * @subsection Requirements on the set
 *
 * Total ordering means there is a trichotomous order predicate `<` such that
 * for any `x` and `y`, exactly one of `x < y`, `y < x` or `x == y` is true.
 * In C++20, this is formalized as `std::totally_ordered` and the comparison
 * predicate as `operator<=>`.
 *
 * @subsection Definition of an interval
 *
 * An interval is a subset given by a lower bound and an upper bound, either of
 * which may be absent ("infinite bound"), and either of which may be open
 * (`<`), denoted with parentheses `()`, or closed (`<=`), denoted with square
 * brackets `[]`. Here's a list of the possible defining inequalities
 *      a < x < b           open, open
 *      a < x <= b          open, closed
 *      a <= x < b          closed, open
 *      a <= x <= b         closed, closed
 *      x < b               missing, open
 *      x <= b              missing, closed
 *      a < x               open, missing
 *      a <= x              closed, missing
 *      <no constraint>     missing, missing (i.e. the whole set)
 * These inequalities are the fundamental defining predicates of an interval,
 * from which all else follows.
 *
 * The empty set is a valid interval, since there is no
 * requirement that the upper bound be greater than the lower bound. A set
 * consisting of a single point `a` is also a valid interval, with upper and
 * lower bounds equal and both closed. The entire set is also valid interval,
 * the case where both bounds are absent.
 *
 * All told, there are 11 distinct kinds of intervals under this definition. The
 * bounds are non-degenerate: `a < b`. It will be clear that a simplistic
 * representation of an interval as two values is inadequate.
 *
 * Group 1
 *      ∅        empty set
 * Group 2
 *      [a,a]    single point, closed
 * Group 3
 *      (a,b)    finite, open
 *      (a,b]    finite, half-open half-closed
 *      [a,b)    finite, half-closed half-open
 *      [a,b]    finite, closed
 * Group 4
 *      (a,+∞)   half-infinite, lower half-open
 *      [a,+∞)   half-infinite, lower half-closed
 * Group 5
 *      (-∞,b)   half-infinite, upper half-open
 *      (-∞,b]   half-infinite, upper half-closed
 * Group 6
 *      (-∞,+∞)  bi-infinite
 *
 * In the implementation, each of these intervals has its own marked
 * constructor.
 *
 * @subsection Motivation
 *
 * For practical applications, it suffices to use the union a set of intervals
 * to represent arbitrary subsets of an ordered set. Every subset representable
 * as a set of intervals has a canonical representation as a set of ordered,
 * strictly separable intervals. This representation provides a solid foundation
 * for parallel and distributed processing.
 *
 * @section Operations
 *
 * @subsection Set membership
 *
 * An interval is a kind of set. Not much more to be said.
 *
 * @subsection Intersection
 *
 * The intersection of two intervals is always an interval. This is one of the
 * reasons that the empty set should be considered an interval. (Mathematically
 * speaking, this closure property means that intervals are a meet-lattice.)
 *
 * @subsection Comparison, strict separation, and adjacency
 *
 * Intervals are partially ordered under a quantified comparison predicate. I_1
 * is less than I_2 if every t_1 in I_1 is less than every t_2 in I_2. Intervals
 * that intersect are never ordered, since for a common element x, x (as a
 * member of one set) is never less than x (as a member of the other).
 *
 * The empty set acts atypically here. Because universal quantifier over an
 * empty set is true, the empty set is less than every set and every set is less
 * than the empty set: ∅ < I < ∅. As a result, we must exclude the empty set
 * from the domain of `<` when considered as a partial order. If intervals that
 * intersect are not ordered, intervals that are disjoint (i.e. don't intersect)
 * are ordered only if neither is empty.
 *
 * Two points are separable if there's a third distinct point between them. Two
 * intervals I_1 and I_2 are separable if every point in I_1 is separable from
 * every point in I_2. Separable intervals are always disjoint and ordered.
 *
 * Disjoint intervals, though, are not always separable; they may not have any
 * point between them. For example consider the intervals [a,b) and [b,c).
 * Disjoint intervals that are not strictly separable are called adjacent.
 *
 * The empty set is disjoint with every other set, but it's also inseparable
 * from every set. The definition of separability is a universal quantifer over
 * points in the set, so it's true for the empty set. Hence the empty set is
 * also adjacent to every set.
 *
 * @subsection Union
 *
 * The union of two intervals is not always an interval, but it can be. The
 * union of separable intervals is never an interval. If two non-empty intervals
 * are not separable, they either intersect or they're adjacent, and in both of
 * these cases their union is an interval. Union with the empty set is also
 * defined; it's the identity operator.
 *
 * @section Complications
 *
 * Of course it's not as simple as the above description might indicate. Some
 * complications are theoretical, some are practical.
 *
 * @subsection Finite types vs. infinite ideas
 *
 * We consider the defining inequalities as upon the mathematical sets on which
 * the intervals are defined, with specific types being finite subsets of them.
 * This matter with boundaries. Consider the integer interval [0,+infinity)
 * represented with k-bit integers. As a representation, it's the same as the
 * interval [0,2^k-1], but we don't use 2^k-1 as a placeholder for "unbounded".
 * If we consider the same interval in 2k-bit integers, we still have
 * [0,+infinity), not [0,2^(2k)-1].
 *
 * In the case of floating point numbers, larger floating point representations
 * admit larger exponents, so we consider those types as dense sets.
 * Accordingly, we abjure the use of `std::nextafter` here, since it's a
 * representation-dependent increment.
 *
 * If type `T` is a subset of type `U` (e.g. `uint8_t` and `uint16_t`, `float`
 * and `double`), then we have a faithful conversion of values in `T` to values
 * in `U`. We also have a conversion from `Interval<T>` to `Interval<U>`. These
 * conversions must keep the defining inequalities intact. Less obviously, we
 * want the same behavior converting from integral types to floating point
 * types.
 *
 * @subsection Discrete vs. dense types
 *
 * A dense set is one that, given any two points, there is another point between
 * them. A discrete set is one where adjacent points are separated from each
 * other by gaps. Dense types are canonically defined by their inequalities, but
 * discrete ones are not. Consider the interval [1,3] over the integers. It's a
 * set with three elements {1,2,3} and has three additional representations as
 * intervals: [1,4) (0,3] (0,4). For the integers, the inequalities a<x and
 * a+1<=x are equivalent to each other, likewise x<b and x<=b-1. We are
 * providing set-theoretic operations for `Interval` and thus we remain agnostic
 * about how a particular set is represented is such operations.
 *
 * Discrete and dense are concepts that are rightly associated with upper and
 * lower neighborhoods of points. Consider a set with lexicographic ordering,
 * for example strings of the symbols {A,B,C,D}. On the upper side, there's
 * always a gap. The first string after `B` is `BA' and there are no strings
 * between them. There is, however, no last string before `B`, because some
 * element of the sequence `AD`, `ADD`, `ADDD`, ... is always after every
 * element that comes before `B`. This is true for every string (except the
 * empty string and the first string `A`), so such sets are generically
 * left-dense and right-discrete.
 *
 * In order to evaluate set-theoretic function and to encompass all these cases,
 * we therefore require an adjacency predicate for the base type. Adjacency is
 * always false for floating point numbers and can be evaluated as a+1==b for
 * integral types. For lexicographic ordering, the adjacency requirement is more
 * involved, but basically says that they can differ in at most their last
 * symbol and that the last symbols have to be adjacent.
 *
 * An open interval on a discrete set may only have a single element. In that
 * case the bounds are twice-adjacent--the lower bound is adjacent to the
 * element and the element is adjacent to the upper bound.
 *
 * @subsection Extended elements. Elements that aren't ordered.
 *
 * Floating point types have two infinity values. In the parlance of IEEE 754,
 * these are "extended numbers". Infinite values are meaningful when used as
 * constructor arguments, but not as ordinary elements. Infinite values, for
 * consistency, are not stored as bounds, but converted to unbounded intervals.
 *
 * Floating point types have two NaN values, quiet and signaling, though the
 * difference is not relevant here. NaN values are not meaningful as numbers.
 * Accordingly, we can't accept NaN as a bound, and so constructors that accept
 * a raw type cannot be labelled `noexcept`. Type members that are not numbers
 * cannot be elements of a set of numbers (obviously?).
