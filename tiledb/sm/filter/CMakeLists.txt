# `byteshuffle_filter` object library

# `byteshuffle_filter` depends on blosc, so we need to add its subdirectory. At
# the present time, that subdirectory is also being added in the main build.
# Adding the same directory twice causes an error. Thus, in the interim, we use
# `blosc-alt` for the binary. This also means that we're compiling blosc
# separately for the main build and for the unit. These separation is temporary
# for the duration of converting the main build into a unit-dependent one.
