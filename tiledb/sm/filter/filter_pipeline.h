   * data, of chunk_filtered_length bytes, which is the chunk after it has
   * passed through the entire pipeline. The chunk_metadata contains any
   * metadata that was added by the filters in the pipeline (may be empty).
   *
   * Each filter in the pipeline transforms the chunk_data bytes
   * arbitrarily. Each filter knows how to interpret the blob of bytes given to
   * it as input when running in reverse.
