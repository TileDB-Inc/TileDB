 * A filter that performs a "byte shuffle" of the input data into the output
 * data buffer.
 *
 * If the input comes in multiple FilterBuffer parts, each part is shuffled
 * independently in the forward direction.
 *
 * Input metadata is not modified.
 *
 * The forward output metadata has the format:
 *   uint32_t - Number of parts
 *   uint32_t - Number of bytes of part0
 *   ...
 *   uint32_t - Number of bytes of partN
 *
 * The forward output data is the concatenated shuffled bytes:
 *   uint8_t[] - Shuffled bytes of part0
 *   ...
 *   uint8_t[] - Shuffled bytes of partN
 *
 * The reverse output data format is simply:
 *   uint8_t[] - Original input data
