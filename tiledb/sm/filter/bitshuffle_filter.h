/**
 * A filter that performs a "bit shuffle" of the input data into the output data
 * buffer.
 *
 * If the input comes in multiple FilterBuffer parts, each part is shuffled
 * independently in the forward direction.
 *
 * Additionally, because the bitshuffling function used requires the input
 * length to be divisible by 8, input parts may each be broken into two parts:
 * the first divisible by 8, and the second the remaining bytes (which are not
 * shuffled, just copied).
 *
 * Input metadata is not modified.
 *
 * The forward output metadata has the format:
 *   uint32_t - Number of parts
 *   uint32_t - Number of bytes of part0
 *   ...
 *   uint32_t - Number of bytes of partN
 *
 * The forward output data is the concatenated shuffled bytes:
 *   uint8_t[] - Shuffled bits of part0
 *   ...
 *   uint8_t[] - Shuffled bits of partN
 *
 * The reverse output data format is simply:
 *   uint8_t[] - Original input data
