 * @section DESCRIPTION
 *
 * This file defines class ChunkedBuffer.
 *
 * The ChunkedBuffer class is used to represent a logically contiguous buffer
 * as a vector of individual buffers. These individual buffers are referred to
 * as "chunk buffers". Each chunk buffer may be allocated individually, which
 * will save memory in scenarios where the logically contiguous buffer is
 * sparsley allocated.
 *
 * After construction, the class must be initialized before performing IO. The
 * initialization determines the following, independent usage paradigms:
 *
 * #1: Chunk Sizes: Fixed/Variable
 * The chunk sizes must be either fixed or variable. An instance with fixed
 * chunk sizes ensures that all chunk buffers are of equal size. The size of the
 * last chunk buffer may be equal-to or less-than the other chunk sizes.
 * Instances with fixed size chunks have a smaller memory footprint and have a
 * smaller algorithmic complexity when performing IO. For variable sized chunks,
 * each chunk size is independent from the others.
 *
 * #2: Chunk Buffer Addressing: Discrete/Contigious
 * The addresses of the individual chunk buffers may or may not be virtually
 * contiguous. For example, the chunk addresses within a virtually contiguous
 * instance may be allocated at address 1024 and 1028, where the first chunk is
 * of size 4. Non-contiguous chunks (referred to as "discrete") may be allocated
 * at any address. The trade-off is that the memory of each discrete chunk is
 * managed individually, where contiguous chunk buffers can be managed by the
 * first chunk alone.
 *
 * #3: Memory Management: Internal/External
 * The chunk buffers may be allocated and freed internally or externally.
 * Internal memory management is exposed through the alloc_*() and free_*()
 * routines. External memory management is exposed through the set_*() routines.
 * Currently, this only supports external memory management for contiguously
 * addressed buffers and internal memory management for discretely addressed
 * buffers.
 *
 * Note that the ChunkedBuffer class does NOT support any concept of ownership.
 * It is up to the caller to free the instance before destruction.
