 * This state machine at present is quite simple. All it does is to process the
 * state transition. It does not have functions associated with events, nor with
 * entering or leaving states. Such functions must be able to throw. The query
 * processing code is not known to work correctly with exceptions in all cases,
 * so such functions are currently not used.
