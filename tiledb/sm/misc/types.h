 * it provides methods that capture common patterns of usage, avoiding bleeding
 * all its abstraction into calling code. It's not perfect, and never will be.
 *
 * A minimal number of vector methods are forwarded outside the class to allow
 * not-yet-converted code its legacy behavior. The incremental goal is to remove
 * such functions as the code base evolves away from untyped variables entirely.
