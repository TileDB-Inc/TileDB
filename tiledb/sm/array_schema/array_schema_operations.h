 * Stores an array schema into persistent storage.

 * @section Maturity Notes
 * This function currently implements defective behavior.
 * Storing an array schema that does not have a URI attached to it should
 * _not_ succeed. Users should be aware of this behavior and avoid storage of
 * schemas with empty URIs.
 * This defect is scheduled for fix asap, but must be documented in the interim.
 *
 * @param resources The context resources.
 * @param array_schema The array schema to be stored.
 * @param encryption_key The encryption key to use.
