    "text": "This directory defines tiledb::common::StatusException and tiledb::common::Status. class Status is a legacy class, originally used as a poor substitute for exceptions. class StatusException is a proper exception class derived from std::exception. StatusException is interconvertible with error Status objects.\n\n\nThe goal is to incrementally replace Status objects with an appropriate replacement. In many cases this will be to throw StatusException instead of returning an error Status, but not in all cases. In some cases a bool may be an appropriate return. In others there might be (or might be created) a semantically appropriate return type that distinguishes between different kinds of failure condititions.\nThere is no particular urgency to this goal. The code has used Status for years. This change is not being made to solve any particular technical defect.\n\n\n\nElimination of code-junk macros RETURN_NOT_OK and their ilk. Error handling is fundamental. It can’t be avoided; it must be faced. In C++ there’s a basic choice to use exceptions or to use return values. There’s syntactic overhead with both. The choice is between try statements with exceptions and return-if-return statements otherwise.\nUsing try statement syntactically marks off error handling code to readily identifiable blocks. Using if statements (or a macro encapsulation) intermixes code for each possible failure in with the code that might fail. Since most failures are rare-to-nonexistent, particularly possible logic errors, try statements end up with code that is far easier to read.\nPromotion of RAII and C.41. When there’s a policy of avoiding exceptions, constructors can’t throw to enforce class invariants. This means that having class invariants requires private constructors and dedicated factory functions in all cases. Of course it’s easier not to do this, which leads to the practice of not defining class invariants. This bypasses the benefits of RAII and obviates the utility of C.41 compliance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nclass StatusException is available for use. Functions that currently return Status but only do so to signal logic errors are immediate candidates for conversion.\nStatus factory classes are still defined in status.h. Prior to beginning this goal, class Status contained a number of member functions to create Status objects with designated origins. These functions required global declaration where local declaration would have been more appropriate. These functions are still declared in status.h but only because the task of moving all the declarations to more appropriate source files has not yet started.\nStatus still has its legacy implementation pattern. Status is due for one more rewrite. Its current internals can be replaced with a single member variable of type optional<StatusException>."

    "text": "Similarly, there are two events associated with the sink: sink_drain, which transitions from full to empty and tells the Sink node that its item has been removed, and and sink_pull, which attempts to transfer an item from the Source and transitions from empty to full. For simplicity, though we may need them in the future, there are currently no defined events for startup, stop, forced shutdown, or abort.\nTo complete the functionality of the state machine for the purposes of safely transferring data from a Source to a Sink, there are exit and entry actions associated with selected states and events.\nDiagrams for the source and sink state machines can be found in source_state_machine.svg and sink_state_machine.svg, respectively.\nThe following diagrams show the entry and exit actions for each state machine, for the Source and Sink in isolation. Note that there is some “spooky action at a distance” between the two due to waiting in one with notification from the other. We don’t show those interactions in the diagram, but capture than in the state transition and event action tables.\n \nOur basic goal for the Source and Sink ports is to transfer a data item from a Source to a connected (bound) Sink. At a high level, the way a client would use the Source to do this is the following: - create a data item - insert the data item into a Source port - invoke the source_fill event - invoke the source_push event\nSimilarly, the desired usage of a Sink port is also to transfer a data item from a Source to a bound Sink. At a high level, the way a client would use the Source is the following - invoke the sink_pull event - extract the data item from the Sink port - consume the item - invoke the sink_drain event\nSince the Source and Sink are bound together, we need to consider a product state machine, one which has all combinations of Source and Sink states. Since the Source and Sink states each have empty and full states, we denote the product states as empty_empty, empty_full, full_empty, and full_full, which represent sourcestate_sinkstate.\nBased on these product states and the four above events, the state transition table for the product state machine (which we will just refer to as the “state machine” below is the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nState\n\n\n\nEvent\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource\nSink\nsource_fill\nsource_push\nsink_drain\nsink_pull\nshutdown\n\n\nempty\nempty\nfull_empty\nempty_empty\n\nempty_full\n\n\n\nempty\nfull\nfull_full\nempty_full\nempty_empty\nempty_full\n\n\n\nfull\nempty\n\nempty_full\n\nempty_full\n\n\n\nfull\nfull\n\nempty_full\nfull_empty\nfull_full\n\n\n\n\nUsing this table, we can include the states as predicates with “proof outline” statements for the Source operation:\n   while (not done) {\n     /* { state = empty_empty ∨ state = empty_full } ∧ { source_item = empty } */\n     do produce and insert item\n     /* { state = empty_empty ∨ state = empty_full } ∧ { source_item = full } */\n     do source_fill\n     /* { state = full_empty ∨ state = full_full } ∧ { source_item = full } */\n     do source_push\n     /* { state = empty_empty ∨ state = empty_full } ∧ { source_item = empty } */\n   }\nSimilarly for Sink:\n   while (not done) {\n     /* { state = empty_empty ∨ state = full_empty } ∧ { sink_item = empty } */\n     do sink_pull\n     /* { state = empty_full ∨ state = full_full } ∧ { sink_item = full } */\n     do extract and consume item  \n     /* { state = empty_full ∨ state = full_full } ∧ { sink_item = full } */\n     do sink_drain\n     /* { state = empty_empty ∨ state = full_empty } ∧ { sink_item = empty } */\n   }\nNow, the Source and Sink need to coordinate source_push and sink_pull so there is not a race condition (nor a deadlock) when making transitions in the state machine. Moreover, we have to make sensible transitions. That is, we only be able to succesfully do a source_push when the Sink state is empty (and the Sink item itself is empty). This is why we insert a new item and then invoke source_fill. Until the state has transitioned to indicate the state of the Source is full, the Sink will not attempt to transfer the item. Similarly, we empty the sink_item and then signal that the Sink is in the empty state.\nTo do this, we associate exit and entry actions with each state transition, some of which will synchronize between Source and Sink. These actions are used with the state transition thusly:\n\nbegin_transition: given old_state and event\nexecute exit(old_state, event)\nnew_state = transition(old_state, event)\nexecute entry(new_state, event)\n\nNote that the exit action is called before the state transition. Note also that the entry action is called with the new state (the post transition state).\nThe tables for exit actions to be perfomed on state transitions is:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStates\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource\nSink\nsource_fill\nsource_push\nsink_drain\nsink_pull\nshutdown\n\n\nempty\nempty\n\n\n\nsink_wait\n\n\n\nempty\nfull\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfull\nempty\n\nsource_swap\n\nsink_swap\n\n\n\nfull\nfull\n\nsource_wait\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe table for entry actions to be performend on state transitions is:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStates\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource\nSink\nsource_fill\nsource_push\nsink_drain\nsink_pull\nshutdown\n\n\nempty\nempty\n\n\nnotify_source\n\n\n\n\nempty\nfull\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfull\nempty\nnotify_sink\nsource_swap\nnotify_source\nsink_swap\n\n\n\nfull\nfull\nnotify_sink\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe source_swap function is used to potentially transfer the data items associated with Source and Sink from the Source to the Sink (as well as changing the state if data transfer is carried out). The source_swap function is invoked whenever the state is full_empty (which is when there is an item in Source and space available to transfer to the Sink. The data transfer is carried out by swapping the Source and Sink items and changing the state of full_empty to empty_full.\nWhen the state is empty_empty, the Sink will wait for the Source to become full. The Source will notify the Sink when it becomes full. Similarly, if the state is full_full, the Source will wait until it is signalled by the Sink that the Sink is empty.\nIn more detail, we can describe the Source behavior (including proof outline predicates);\n  init: { state = empty_empty ∧ source_item = empty }\n  while (not done)\n\n     /* { state = empty_empty ∨ state = empty_full } ∧ { source_item = empty } */\n     client of the source inserts an item  /* Note that although the Sink can execute and potentially change the\n                                              state here, the allowable transitions do not end up changing it */\n\n     /* { state = empty_empty ∨ state = empty_full } ∧ { source_item = full } */\n     client invokes source_fill event to transition from empty to full.\n\n     /* state machine locks mutex */\n     state machine invokes exit action\n     if { state = empty_empty ∨ state = empty_full } → none\n     /* { state = empty_empty ∨ state = empty_full } ∧ { source_item = full } */\n     state machine performs transition\n       { state = empty_empty } → { state = full_empty } ∧ { source_item = full } */\n       { state = empty_full } → { state = full_full } ∧ { source_item = full } */\n     /* { state = full_empty ∨ state = full_full } ∧ { source_item = full } */\n     Source notifies Sink that it is full\n     /* { state = full_empty ∨ state = full_full } ∧ { source_item = full } */\n     Source returns\n     /* state machine unlocks mutex */\n\n     /* Before the Source begins the source_push, the Sink may pull, drain, do both, or do nothing */\n\n     /* { state = full_empty ∨ state = full_full ∨ state = empty_full ∨ state = empty_empty } ∧ { source_item = empty ∨ source_item = full } */\n     client invokes source_push event\n     state machine locks the mutex\n\n     /* { state = full_empty ∨ state = full_full ∨ state = empty_full ∨ state = empty_empty } ∧ { source_item = empty ∨ source_item = full } */\n     state machine executes source_push exit action, which may be one of the following, depending on the state */\n       if { state = empty_empty ∨ state = empty_full } → none\n       if state = full_empty → execute source_swap\n       if state = full_full → execute source_wait\n         /* pre_source_swap: { state = full_empty } ∧ { source_item = full } */\n            state machine swaps source_item and sink_item -- swap does not change state\n         /* post_source_swap: { state = full_empty } ∧ { source_item = empty } */\n       if { state = full_full } → execute source_wait  /* wait for Sink to become empty */\n          /* Important!

When the Source or Sink wait, they do so on a condition variable using that same lock.\nSince the synchronization implies that if the Source and Sink execute the same number of loops, the Source will have { state = empty_empty ∨ state = empty_full } while the Sink will have { state = empty_empty ∨ state = full_empty }. The final state of the state machine must be { state = empty_empty ∨ state = empty_full } ∧ { state = empty_empty ∨ state = full_empty } ∧ { item = empty }, i.e., { state = empty_empty } ∧ { item = empty }.\nNB: The sink_swap and source_swap functions are identical. Each checks to see if the state is equal to full_empty, if so, swap the state to empty_full (and perform an action swap of the items assoiated with the source and sink), and notifies the other. If the state is not equal to full_empty, the swap function notifies the other and goes into a wait.\nThus, we may not need separate swaps for Source and Sink, nor separate condition variables, nor separate notification functions. I have verified that this works experimentally, but I am leaving things separate for now."

In this case there are no chunk metadata bytes (since there are no filters to add metadata), and the filtered bytes are the same as original bytes.\nThe “chunk metadata” before the actual “chunk filtered data” depend on the particular sequence of filters in the pipeline. In the simple case, each filter will simply concatenate its metadata to the chunk metadata region. Because some filters in the pipeline may wish to filter the metadata of previous filters (e.g. compression, where it is beneficial to compress previous filters’ metadata in addition to the actual chunk data), the ordering of filters also impacts the metadata that is eventually written to disk.\nThe “chunk filtered data” bytes contain the final bytes of the chunk after being passed through the entire pipeline. When reading tiles from disk, the filter pipeline is run in the reverse order.\nInternally, any filter in a filter pipeline produces two arrays of data as output: a metadata byte array and a filtered data byte array. Additionally, these output byte arrays can be arbitrarily separated into “parts” by any filter. Typically, when a next filter receives the output of the previous filter as its input, it will filter each “part” independently.\n\nByteshuffle Filter\nThe byteshuffle filter does not filter input metadata, and the output data is guaranteed to be the same length as the input data.\nThe byteshuffle filter produces output metadata in the format:\n\n\n\nField\nType\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nNumber of parts\nuint32_t\nNumber of data parts\n\n\nLength of part 1\nuint32_t\nNumber of bytes in data part 1\n\n\n…\n…\n…\n\n\nLength of part N\nuint32_t\nNumber of bytes in data part N\n\n\n\nThe byteshuffle filter produces output data in the format:\n\n\n\nField\nType\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nPart 1\nuint8_t[]\nByteshuffled data part 1\n\n\n…\n…\n…\n\n\nPart N\nuint8_t[]\nByteshuffled data part N\n\n\n\n\n\nBitshuffle Filter\nThe bitshuffle filter does not filter input metadata.

    "text": "New features\n\nWindows support. TileDB is now fully supported on Windows systems (64-bit Windows 7 and newer).\nPython API. We are very excited to announce the initial release of a Python API for TileDB. The Python API makes TileDB accessible to a much broader audience, allowing seamless integration with existing Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas and the scientific Python ecosystem.\nC++ API. We’ve included a C++ API, which allows TileDB to integrate into modern C++ applications without having to write code towards the C API. The C++ API is more concise and provides additional compile time type safety.\nS3 object store support. You can now easily store, query, and manipulate your TileDB arrays on S3 API compatibile object stores, including Amazon’s AWS S3 service.\nVirtual filesystem interface. The TileDB API now exposes a virtual filesystem (or VFS) interface, allowing you to perform tasks such as file creation, deletion, reads, and appends without worrying about whether your files are stored on S3, HDFS, a POSIX or Windows filesystem, etc.\nKey-value store. TileDB now provides a key-value (meta) data storage abstraction. Its implementation is built upon TileDB’s sparse arrays and inherits all the properties of TileDB sparse arrays."

    "text": "Hi! Thanks for your interest in TileDB. The following notes are intended to help you file issues, bug reports, or contribute code to the open source TileDB project.\n\n\n\nReporting a bug? Please read how to file a bug report section to make sure sufficient information is included.\nContributing code? You rock! Be sure to review the contributor section for helpful tips on the tools we use to build TileDB, format code, and issue pull requests (PR)’s.\n\n\n\n\nA useful bug report filed as a GitHub issue provides information about how to reproduce the error.\n\nBefore opening a new GitHub issue try searching the existing issues to see if someone else has already noticed the same problem.\nWhen filing a bug report, provide where possible:\n\n\nThe version TileDB (tiledb_version()) or if a dev version, specific commit that triggers the error.\nThe full error message, including the backtrace (if possible). Verbose error reporting is enabled by building TileDB with ../bootstrap --enable-verbose.\nA minimal working example, i.e. the smallest chunk of code that triggers the error. Ideally, this should be code that can be a small reduced C / C++ source file. If the code to reproduce is somewhat long, consider putting it in a gist.\n\n\nWhen pasting code blocks or output, put triple backquotes (```) around the text so GitHub will format it nicely. Code statements should be surrounded by single backquotes (`). See GitHub’s guide on Markdown for more formatting tricks.\n\n\n\n\nBy contributing code to TileDB, you are agreeing to release it under the MIT License.\n\n\nPlease see building from source for dependencies and detailed build instructions.\nFrom a fork of TileDB\ngit clone https://github.com/username/TileDB\ncd TileDB && mkdir build && cd build\n../bootstrap\nmake && make check\ncd ../\ngit checkout -b <my_initials>/<my_bugfix_branch>\n... code changes ...\nmake -C build format\nmake -C build check\ngit commit -a -m \"my commit message\"\ngit push --set-upstream origin <my_initials>/<my_bugfix_branch>\nIssue a PR from your updated TileDB fork\nBranch conventions: - dev is the development branch of TileDB, all PR’s are merged into dev. - master tracks the latest stable / released version of TileDB. - release-x.y.z are major / bugfix release branches of TileDB.\nFormatting conventions: - 2 spaces per indentation level not tabs - class names use CamelCase - member functions, variables use lowercase with underscores - class member variables use a trailing underscore foo_ - comments are good, TileDB uses doxygen for class doc strings. - format code using clang-format\n\n\n\n\ndev is the development branch, all PR’s should be rebased on top of the latest dev commit.\nCommit changes to a local branch. The convention is to use your initials to identify branches: (ex. “Fred Jones” , fj/my_bugfix_branch). Branch names should be identifiable and reflect the feature or bug that they want to address / fix. This helps in deleting old branches later.\nMake sure the test suite passes by running make check.\nWhen ready to submit a PR, git rebase the branch on top of the latest dev commit. Be sure to squash / cleanup the commit history so that the PR preferably one, or a couple commits at most. Each atomic commit in a PR should be able to pass the test suite.\nRun the limiting / code format tooling (make format) before submitting a final PR. Make sure that your contribution generally follows the format and naming conventions used by surrounding code.\nIf the PR changes/adds/removes user-facing API or system behavior (such as API changes), add a note to the TileDB/HISTORY.md file.\nSubmit a PR, writing a descriptive message. If a PR closes an open issue, reference the issue in the PR message (ex. If an issue closes issue number 10, you would write closes #10)\nMake sure CI (continuous integration) is passing for your PR – click Show all checks in the pull request status box at the bottom of each PR page. The continous integration project pages will also list all recently-built PRs:\n\nAzure Pipelines\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTileDB uses Sphinx as its documentation generator.\nDocumentation is written in reStructuredText markup.\n\nBuilding the docs locally:\n$ cd TileDB/doc\n$ ./local-build.sh\nThis will install all the required packages in a Python virtual environment, and build the docs locally. You can then open the doc/source/_build/html/index.html file in your browser.\nNote: If there are additions to the C/C++ API in between builds, rerun bootstrap:\n$ cd ../build\n$ ../bootstrap <flags>\n\n\n\n\nTileDB\n\nHomepage\nDocumentation\nIssues\nForum\nOrganization\n\nGithub / Git\n\nGit cheatsheet\nGithub Documentation\nForking a Repo\nMore Learning Resources"
