<!-- Automatic history file management:
  Set the type to one of FORMAT, BREAKING_API, BREAKING_BEHAVIOR, FEATURE, IMPROVEMENT, DEPRECATION, BUG, C_API, CPP_API or NO_HISTORY.
  NO_HISTORY should be used rarely. It is mostly associated with repo level changes (README/CI/etc) that do not need to be logged in
  the HISTORY.md file for version updates.
  Set the DESC to a one line summary of the change
